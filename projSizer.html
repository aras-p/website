<h2>Sizer - executable size breakdown <i>(2007)</i></h2>

<p>
Command line tool that reports size of things (functions, data, classes, templates, object files) in a Visual Studio compiled exe/dll. Extracts info from debug information (.pdb) file.
</p>
<p>
Based on code by Fabian "ryg" Giesen (<a href='http://farbrausch.com/~fg/'>farbrausch.com/~fg</a>).
</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>
Version 0.1.3 <a href="files/sizer/Sizer-0.1.3.zip"><b>here</b></a> (53 KB). Includes executable, source and project file for Visual Studio 2003.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ol>
<li>Compile your executable with Visual Studio, with symbol database (.pdb).</li>
<li>Run <tt>Sizer.exe &lt;path-to-exe-file&gt;</tt> from command line. Optionally redirect stdout to a file.</li>
<li>Output is a text file that lists functions, aggregated templates, data, classes/namespaces and object files, sorted by size, largest to smallest.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It requires either having Visual Studio 2003/2005 to be installed, or having <tt>msdia71.dll</tt> or <tt>msdia80.dll</tt> in Sizer's folder on in path. Since I'm not sure what
are distribution terms of msdia*.dll, I'm not including it in the download. It looks like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=32bc1bee-a3f9-4c13-9c99-220b62a191ee&DisplayLang=en">VS2005 redist</a>
does contain the dlls.
</p>
<p>Output will look like this:</p>

<h3>Changelog</h3>
<pre>
0.1.3, 2008 01 17
  aras: fixed a crash on some executables (IDiaSymbol2::get_type may return S_FALSE). Reported by Ivan-Assen Ivanov.
  aras: print a dot for each 1000 symbols read. Some executables spend ages inside DIA dlls.

0.1.2, 2008 01 14
  ryg: added support for VC8.0 DIA DLL
  ryg: added support for loading DIA DLLs that are not registered (drop msdia*.dll into app folder)
  ryg: split up "data" report into data and BSS (uninitialized data) sections
  ryg: fixed some size computations
  aras: strip whitespace from symbol names (often happens with templates)

0.1.1, 2008 01 13
  aras: improved error messages
  aras: removed unused source files

0.1, 2008 01 13
  initial release
</pre>


<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The results are only as good as the information you put in. If you compile without debug information, the PDB will only contain
relatively rough info about public symbols and not much else. For example, data declared static will be reported as belonging to
the nearest public symbol - it's stored like that in the PDB, and there's no way of getting more detailed information. So if
you see something weird, like a 14k uninitialized array that you know for a fact is only 1k big, what's happened is that all
the uninitialized data following that symbol has been attributed to it. Compile your executable <i>with debug symbols on</i>
(they don't blow up the size, since everything is in a separate PDB file).</li>
<li>The sizes reported are raw, uncompressed sizes. Most application installers will compress the executable, and compression may vary wildly depending on the code itself.</li>
<li>On some executables it takes ages to read the PDB information - often it can read 10000 symbols in a second, but on some executables it takes a minute or two. I don't
quite know why; profiler says all the time is spent in DIA dll.</li>
</ul>
