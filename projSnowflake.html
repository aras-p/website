<H2>Snowflake Generator</H2>

<H3>Story</H3>
<P>
In March 2002 <I>Kestutis Tauchkela aka ProNinja</I> (a widely known person
among the few Lithuanian game developers) announced a "Lithuania's C++ Guru"
coding contest. The task was to write a snowflake image generator. Of course,
there were many discussions: whether this task shows any C++ programming skills
at all, what are the precise requirements (afterall, what is "a good
snowflake"?), etc. However, the contest began.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, there were only two entries... The one presented here was grantly
assigned a first place by jury <I>(that is, Kestutis)</I>.
</P>

<H3>Info</H3>
<P>
What I did was a <I>kind-of</I>-L-System based snowflake generator (and with
some bonus rules and effects for fun). As the contest was called "C++ guru", I
used bits of C++ features (templates, OOP) here and there (mostly where they
were absolutely unneeded).
</P>
<P>
As the program had to work on simple Pentium MMX computer with no 3D accelerator
and other fancy features, I've had a chance to remember old times - doing things
by hand: line drawing, transparency, sorting, z-buffer (actually z-buffer
is not needed, but used for "fun" post-processing filters like image-space edge
detection). It was pretty cool :)

<H3>Download</H3>
<P>
Binary and source release <A href="files/snowflake.zip"><B>here</B></A> (85 KB).
Compiles under MSVC6 (should compile with others as well), runs from the
command line with args (that was the requirement).
